We’re promoting the importance of inclusivity in the design and administration of forms, interfaces, apps, databases and CRM systems. We’re also providing materials and guidance on how administrators can incorporate inclusive and non-discriminatory language and techniques into their work.

### Guide
Our guide will take you through a variety of scenarios and explain how you can promote inclusivity in your forms, designs and systems.

### Resources
Our resources include downloadable picklist values, data-sheets, best practices and materials which can be freely used in your projects and passed to decision-makers in your organisation.

### About
In the spirit of inclusivity, this site’s written content is open-source and ready to collaborate. Go to the about page to find out how you can help us.
